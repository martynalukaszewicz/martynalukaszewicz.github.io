#### Current Project ####
I am co-advised by [Paul Hohenlohe](http://hohenlohelab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Erkan Buzbas](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/erkanbuzbas/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Idaho. I work on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to study divergent selection in yeast. 


#### Previous Projects ####
For my master's thesis I worked under supervision of [Brian Dennis](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/dennis){:target="_blank"}. I developed a technique to estimate sample sizes of multinomial and product multinomial models with known proportions of almond orchards per development stage when empirical proportions are available but not the counts.
