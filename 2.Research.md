#### Current Project ####
I am co-advised by [Paul Hohenlohe](http://hohenlohelab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Erkan Buzbas](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/erkanbuzbas/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Idaho. I develop in-siloco methods and apply Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to study evolutionary processes via mechanistic approach. Publication in preparation.

#### Previous Projects ####
For my master's thesis I worked under supervision of [Brian Dennis](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/dennis/){:target="_blank"}, also at the University of Idaho. I developed a technique to estimate sample sizes of multinomial and product multinomial models to estimate timings of phenological eventa. Publication in review.
