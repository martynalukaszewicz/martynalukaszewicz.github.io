#### Current Project ####
I am co-advised by [Paul Hohenlohe](http://hohenlohelab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Erkan Buzbas](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/erkanbuzbas/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Idaho. I develop Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to study divergent selection in yeast. Publication in preparation.

#### Previous Projects ####
For my master's thesis I worked under supervision of [Brian Dennis](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/faculty/dennis/){:target="_blank"}, also at the University of Idaho. I developed a technique to estimate sample sizes of multinomial and product multinomial models with known proportions of almond orchards per development stage when empirical proportions are available but not the counts. Publication in review.
