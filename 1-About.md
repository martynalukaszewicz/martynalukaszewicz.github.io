I am a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program. 
I am co-advised by [Paul Hohenlohe](http://hohenlohelab.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Erkan Buzbas](http://webpages.uidaho.edu/erkanbuzbas/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Idaho. I work on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods to study divergent selection in yeast.
